  <h2>Your duties and commitments to Us.</h2>
  We provide You and other with this Service, We, in turn, ask You to meet and make the following expectations and commitments:
  <h3>Who can use CodeWe?</h3>
  <p>
    We try to make this Service as broadly available to any and everyone who wishes to use it, but We don‚Äôt allow You to use Our Service SHOULD:
  <ul>
    <li>
      You be under the legal age of 18 and not have consent from Your parents or guardians;

      We have revoked or disabled Your access to CodeWe following a breach of Our Terms or Policies;
    </li>
    <li>
      You are prohibited or not allowed to receive or access CodeWe under applicable laws.
    </li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <h3>What can You share and do on CodeWe?</h3>
  <p>
    We wish that people can use CodeWe to share and collaborate on algorithms and code freely but under no circumstance at the expense of the safety of You and others. You, therefore, agree not to engage in the behaviour or conduct described below
    (or to facilitate or support others in doing so):
  <ul>
    <li>
      You MUST NOT use CodeWe to do or share anything‚Ä¶
      <ul>
        <li>‚Ä¶ that breaches these Terms or Policies;</li>
        <li>‚Ä¶ that is unlawful, discriminatory or fraudulent;</li>
        <li>
          ‚Ä¶ that infringes or breaches someone else‚Äôs rights, including intellectual property rights.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      You also MUST NOT use CodeWe to create or share viruses, malware, spyware, malicious code or scripts, or do anything that could disable, overburden, or impair the proper and correct working or appearance of CodeWe.
    </li>
    <li>
      You MUST NOT access or collect data from CodeWe using automated means (without Our prior permission) or attempt to access data that You do not have permission to access.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  We reserve Ourselves the right to remove, delete or block content that breaches these Terms without prior notice to anyone.
  <br>
  If We remove, delete or block content that You have made available or shared for violating these Terms, We MAY try to notify You in a reasonable delay by mean easily accessible to Us.
  <br>
  We also can remove or restrict access to Your content or information if We determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory disputes or impacts on/to Us.
  </p>
  <h3>Permission You give Us.</h3>
  <p>
    To correctly and efficiently provide You with Our Service, We need permission Your permission to store or save content You create and share
    <br>
    The content You create and share is saved temporarily in our database. Some content that You create and make available to others MAY be protected by intellectual property rights.
    <br>
    You (or the owner) own(s) the intellectual property rights (e.g.: copyright or trademarks) in any such content that You create or share on CodeWe. Nothing in these Terms takes away these rights You have to Your content. You are free to share or
    not Your content with anyone else, whenever You want.
    <br>
    However, to be able to provide Our Service, You MUST give Us legal permissions (‚Äúlicense‚Äù) to store or save this content. This is solely for the purpose to provide Our Service (as described above).
    <br>
    Specifically, when You create, share or make available content that is covered by intellectual property rights, on CodeWe, You grant Us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, and worldwide licence or authorisation to host,
    save, store, distribute, modify, run, copy, duplicate, publicly display and create derivative works of Your content.
    <br>
    <i>
      Example: You share a script on CodeWe. You give Us permission to store, save, copy and share it with others. This is the intent after all, isn‚Äôt it?
    </i>
    <br>
    Content stored for longer than 48 hours after last activity or view will automatically be removed. You can download the content You created or shared anytime by using the ‚ÄúDownload‚Äù button.
    <br>
    When content is deleted, it‚Äôs no longer accessible to other users, however, it MAY continue to exist elsewhere on CodeWe where:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Immediate deletion is not possible due to technical limitations, in which case Your content will be deleted within a maximum of 10 working days from the day it was marked for deletion;
    </li>
    <li>
      Immediate deletion, or deletion in general, would restrict Our ability to‚Ä¶
      <ul>
        <li>
          ‚Ä¶ investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of Our Terms and/or Policies;
        </li>
        <li>
          ‚Ä¶ comply with legal obligations, such as preservation of evidence;
        </li>
        <li>
          ‚Ä¶ comply with a request from a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or government agency.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  in which cases the content will be retained for longer than necessary for the purpose of which it has been retained. This extra duration MAY vary case-by-case.
  <br>
  If the content is retained for longer; this license will prevail and continue to be valid until the content has been fully deleted.
  </p>

  </p>

  <h2>Suspenstion or Termination</h2>
  <p>
    We want CodeWe to be a place to safely share and collaborate.
    <br>

  <h1>Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels</h1>
  <h2>Status of this Memo</h2>
  <p>
    This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements. Distribution of this memo is unlimited.
  </p>
  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>
    In many standards track documents several words are used to signify the requirements in the specification. These words are often capitalized. This document defines these words as they should be interpreted in IETF documents. Authors who follow
    these guidelines should incorporate this phrase near the beginning of their document:
    <br>
    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.
    <br>
    Note that the force of these words is modified by the requirement level of the document in which they are used.
  </p>
  <h2>MUST</h2>
  <p>
    This word, or the terms "REQUIRED" or "SHALL", mean that the definition is an absolute requirement of the specification.
  </p>
  <h2>MUST NOT</h2>
  <p>
    This phrase, or the phrase "SHALL NOT", mean that the definition is an absolute prohibition of the specification.
  </p>
  <h2>SHOULD</h2>
  <p>
    This word, or the adjective "RECOMMENDED", mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore a particular item, but the full implications must be understood and carefully weighed before choosing a different course.
  </p>
  <h2>SHOULD NOT</h2>
  <p>
    This phrase, or the phrase "NOT RECOMMENDED" mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances when the particular behavior is acceptable or even useful, but the full implications should be understood and the case carefully
    weighed before implementing any behavior described with this label.
  </p>
  <h2>MAY</h2>
  <p>
    This word, or the adjective "OPTIONAL", mean that an item is truly optional. One vendor may choose to include the item because a particular marketplace requires it or because the vendor feels that it enhances the product while another vendor may
    omit the same item. An implementation which does not include a particular option MUST be prepared to interoperate with another implementation which does include the option, though perhaps with reduced functionality. In the same vein an
    implementation which does include a particular option MUST be prepared to interoperate with another implementation which does not include the option (except, of course, for the feature the option provides.)
  </p>
  <h2>Guidance in the use of these Imperatives</h2>
  <p>
    Imperatives of the type defined in this memo must be used with care and sparingly. In particular, they MUST only be used where it is actually required for interoperation or to limit behavior which has potential for causing harm (e.g., limiting
    retransmisssions). For example, they must not be used to try to impose a particular method on implementors where the method is not required for interoperability.
  </p>
  <h2>Security Considerations</h2>
  <p>
    These terms are frequently used to specify behavior with security implications. The effects on security of not implementing a MUST or SHOULD, or doing something the specification says MUST NOT or SHOULD NOT be done may be very subtle. Document
    authors should take the time to elaborate the security implications of not following recommendations or requirements as most implementors will not have had the benefit of the experience and discussion that produced the specification.
  </p>
  <h2>Acknowledgments</h2>
  <p>
    The definitions of these terms are an amalgam of definitions taken from a number of RFCs. In addition, suggestions have been incorporated from a number of people including Robert Ullmann, Thomas Narten, Neal McBurnett, and Robert Elz.

  <h1>Ambiguity of Uppercase vs Lowercase in RFC 2119 Key Words</h1>
  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>
    RFC 2119 specifies common key words that may be used in protocol specifications. This document aims to reduce the ambiguity by clarifying that only UPPERCASE usage of the keywords have the defined special meanings.
  </p>
  <h2>Status of This Memo</h2>
  <p>
    This memo documents an Internet Best Current Practice.<br>

    This document is a product of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). It represents the consensus of the IETF community. It has received public review and has been approved for publication by the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG).
    Further information on BCPs is available in Section 2 of RFC 7841.<br>

    Information about the current status of this document, any errata, and how to provide feedback on it may be obtained at http://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc8174.

    This document is subject to BCP 78 and the IETF Trust's Legal Provisions Relating to IETF Documents (http://trustee.ietf.org/license-info) in effect on the date of publication of this document. Please review these documents carefully, as they

  </p>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    RFC 2119 specifies common key words, such as "MUST", "SHOULD", and "MAY", that may be used in protocol specifications. It says that the key words "are often capitalized," which has caused confusion about how to interpret non-capitalized words
    such as "must" and "should".
    <br>
    This document updates RFC 2119 by clarifying that only UPPERCASE usage of the key words have the defined special meanings. This document is part of BCP 14.
  </p>
  <h2>Clarifying Capitalization of Key Words</h2>
  <p>
    The following change is made to [RFC2119]:

    In many standards track documents several words are used to signify the requirements in the specification. These words are often capitalized. This document defines these words as they should be interpreted in IETF documents. Authors who follow
    these guidelines should incorporate this phrase near the beginning of their document:
    <br>
    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

    <br>
    In many IETF documents, several words, when they are in all capitals as shown below, are used to signify the requirements in the specification. These capitalized words can bring significant clarity and consistency to documents because their
    meanings are well defined. This document defines how those words are interpreted in IETF documents when the words are in all capitals.
  <ul>
    <li>
      These words can be used as defined here, but using them is not required. Specifically, normative text does not require the use of these key words. They are used for clarity and consistency when that is what's wanted, but a lot of normative text
      does not use them and is still normative.
    </li>
    <li>
      The words have the meanings specified herein only when they are in all capitals.
    </li>
    <li>
      When these words are not capitalized, they have their normal English meanings and are not affected by this document.
    </li>
  </ul>
  Authors who follow these guidelines should incorporate this phrase near the beginning of their document:
  <br>
  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only
  when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.
